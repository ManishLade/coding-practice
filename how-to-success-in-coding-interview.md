## Basic Data Structures
## Array
* Pattern & Technique
  Whenever getting a problem that related to array, ask yourself the following questions:  
  1. Is the array sorted? If not, does sorting the array help to simplfy the problem?
  2. Can I use two and / or multiple pointers? The two pointers could be composed as a sliding window. Or, the two pointers could be put at the beginning and end of the array. Both sliding window and beginning-end pointers could help to reduce the time / space complexity.
